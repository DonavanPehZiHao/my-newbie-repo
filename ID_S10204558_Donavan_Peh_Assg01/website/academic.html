                        ​Computing is the first course that caught my attention when I am choosing what subject that I will be taking for Secondary 3 and 4. At first, I am only interested in how games works but later, I saw hackers in movie trying to hack into a system and I thought that is kind of cool and that is the beginning of my exploration of the cyber world.
